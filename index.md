The noun ‘dividation’ means an unrestricted and generalized totality of acts of seeing
things as separate. As has been indicated earlier, di-vidation implies a division in the
attention-calling function of the word, in the sense that di-vidation is seen to be different
from vidation. [...] Rather, their very forms indicate that dividation is a kind of vidation,
indeed a special case of the latter. So ultimately, wholeness is primary, in the sense that
these meanings and functions pass into each other to merge and interpenetrate. Division
is thus seen to be a convenient means of giving a more articulated and detailed description
to this whole, rather than a fragmentation of ‘what is’. The movement from division to
oneness of perception is through the action of ordering. For example, a ruler may be divided
into inches, but this set of divisions is introduced into our thinking only as a convenient
means of expressing a simple sequential order, which we can communicate and understand
something that has bearing on some whole object, which is measured with the aid of such a
ruler. [...] But, of course, more complex orders are possible, and these have to be expressed
in terms of more subtle divisions and categories of thought, which are significant for more
subtle forms of movement. [...] Beyond all these orders is that of the movement of attention.
This movement has to have an order that fits the order in that which is to be observed, or
else we will miss seeing what is to be seen.

ACADEMIA
I am a theoretical physics PhD student in Imperial College London, interested in quantum gravity. See my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YwZjck3s9JpT8_QpVIxOxCQijO4XIHky/view?usp=sharing">CV</a>

My current work focuses on quantum cosmology: the idea of describing the whole Universe as a quantum mechanical object,
i.e. a wave function, rather than as classical spacetime. I am investigating the implication of second class constraint to the solution
of the Wheeler DeWitt equation, challenging the equivalence between metric and connection representation of General Relativity at the quantum level. In particular, I am studying the impact of torsion on the probability of inflation for the Vilenkin proposal of the wavefunction of the universe. This is a general <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J5UK7uXG0vLbZwureOpVulwqLkFTr8Ng/view?usp=sharing"> route</a> for my PhD, although I guess that the fun part is to explore topics off-tracks and getting lost.

WHY DON'T WE TRY TO DISCRETIZE SPACETIME?
But you have correctly grasped the drawback that the continuum brings. If the molec-
ular view of matter is the correct (appropriate) one, i.e., if a part of the universe is to be
represented by a finite number of moving points, then the continuum of the present theory
contains too great a manifold of possibilities. I also believe that this too great is responsible
for the fact that our present means of description miscarry with the quantum theory. The
problem seems to me how one can formulate statements about a discontinuum without
calling upon a continuum (space-time) as an aid; the latter should be banned from the
theory as a supplementary construction not justified by the essence of the problem, which
corresponds to nothing “real”. But we still lack the mathematical structure unfortunately.
How much have I already plagued myself in this way!
