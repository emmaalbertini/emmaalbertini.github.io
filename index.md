ACADEMIA
I am a theoretical physics PhD student in Imperial College London, interested in quantum gravity. See my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v4pHm6kg-nnuuuIXae9ZjrYKUGUB2E4p/view?usp=sharing">CV</a>

My current work focuses on quantum cosmology: the idea of describing the whole Universe as a quantum mechanical object,
i.e. a wave function, rather than as classical spacetime. I am investigating the implication of second class constraint to the solution
of the Wheeler DeWitt equation, challenging the equivalence between metric and connection representation of General Relativity at the quantum level. In particular, I am atudying the impact of torsion on the probability of inflation for the Vilenkin proposal of the wavefunction of the universe. This is a general <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J5UK7uXG0vLbZwureOpVulwqLkFTr8Ng/view?usp=sharing"> route</a> for my PhD, although I guess that the fun part is to explore topics off-tracks without
